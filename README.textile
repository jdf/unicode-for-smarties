h2. Unicode for Smarties

This is a slide deck to accompany a talk I've been giving at IBM.
The idea is to spend an hour giving technially-inclined people
the conceptual foundation they need to understand Unicode, and
to solve Unicode-related problems they might encounter in their
day-to-day work.

A couple of the illustrations are taken from the Unicode standard,
and are copyright (c)The Unicode Consortium.

Otherwise, the slide deck itself is licensed
